{"name":"Self-organization-constitution","tagline":"An open source constitution for responsive organizations. Inspired by Sociocracy, Holacracy, Self-Management, Reinventing Organizations, etc.","body":"#README\r\n\r\nThe primary self-organization constitution document is [here](CONSTITUTION.md).\r\n\r\n**Note:** This version of the constitution is new and being vetted by pioneering organizations. Your feedback as a pioneer, practitioner, or engaged observer is very welcome.\r\n\r\n###Principles\r\n\r\n* **Distribute Authority** - Members are free to take actions that further the organization's purpose by default.\r\n* **Evolve** - Define organizational rules and roles iteratively based on the challenges that members experience. Make progress even over perfection.\r\n* **Evidence** - Base decisions and actions on evidence.\r\n\r\n###Why is this constitution needed?\r\n\r\nYour group of 2-20 people needs a clear way to fulfill its purpose, make decisions, get things done, and respond to change.\r\n* To fit your values your constitution must be egalitarian.\r\n* In order to respond to change and adapt to your unique context you must be able to evolve your constitution.\r\n* To learn from other groups you need to be able to share innovations freely.\r\n* In order to build capacity rapidly with changing team members your constitution must also be simple.\r\n\r\nIf this is what you are looking for, [this constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) is for you.\r\n\r\n###How do you adopt this constitution?\r\n\r\n1. Each member of the organization defines roles based on the activities they are currently doing. The mission holders of the organization define the purpose & values through a process they choose.\r\n2. Grant the roles defined by the organization's members and the default roles: Role Assigner, Facilitator, and Treasurer. Remember, roles can be held by multiple people and people can hold multiple roles.\r\n3. Have those with sufficient authority ratify the constitution for self-organization.\r\n4. Have regular meetings to make proposals. Document the proposals in the adopted proposal section below.\r\n\r\n###Why are there no circles or groups defined in the constitution?\r\n\r\nThe focus of this constitution is for small groups of 2-20. There are several design patterns for scaling. Rather than biasing in one direction or another at the outset, the constitution gives space for the organization to evolve.\r\n\r\nTwo potential scaling patterns are: nested holonic circle structures as employed by Sociocracy & Holacracy; and networked structures such as Morning Star's [Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU)](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute scaling \"proposal pattern\", your contributions would be welcome. For example you could contribute a sociocracy style double linked circle \"proposal pattern\".\r\n\r\n###Legal\r\n\r\nThe materials in this constitution are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice.\r\n\r\nFor maximum usability, this constitution is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication:\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0\r\n\r\n###Attribution\r\n\r\nYou are not required to include attribution if you redistribute this constitution.
