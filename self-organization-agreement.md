#Self-Organization Agreement

##Principles

* **Distribute Authority** - Members are free to take actions that further the organization's purpose by default.
* **Evolve** - Define organizational rules and roles iteratively based on the challenges that members experience. Make progress even over perfection.
* **Evidence** - Base decisions and actions on evidence. 

##Freedom To Self-Organize

You are free to take any action that fulfills the purpose of the organization and the roles that you hold. In doing so, you must not break any explicitly defined rule and you must uphold the values of the organization. 

##Proposal Adoption Process

If you personally experience a frustration or tension you can make a proposal that addresses your problem. The proposal can be to affect a role, rule, action, purchase, purpose, strategy, or change to this agreement. You can make your proposal electronically or at a meeting. The proposal must be proposed to the group affected by the proposal.

A facilitator facilitates the process if it is an in person meeting. 

**This is the proposal adoption process:**

1. The person experiencing the need for change makes their proposal to the group of affected people. They explain the tension or frustration that they are personally feeling and what the proposal is.
1. Any group member can ask clarifying questions.
1. Each group member is given space to give their reaction to the proposal.
1. Each group member can then respond with “objection” or “no objection”. 
    1. Objections are tested by the facilitator for validity. Objections are valid only if they are based on evidence that the adoption of the proposal would cause significant harm. 
    2. Valid objections are resolved between the proposer and the objector. The proposer chooses how to amend their proposal based on suggestions. 
1. Modified proposals are then re-presented to the group for objections.
1. If there are no valid objections, then the proposal is adopted
1. The adopted proposal and the specific need for change are then recorded.

Proposals that are adopted can be modified through the proposal adoption process.

##Rules

Rules govern the resources of the organization. They are decided through the proposal process.

##Roles

Roles and their accountabilities are defined through proposals. Roles are defined separately from people. 

People are assigned to roles by a person with a “role assigner” role. A person can be assigned to multiple roles. A person can resign from roles they do not wish to hold. People are only accountable for roles they hold.

##Members

Members of the organization can participate in the proposal adoption process, hold a role, or employ the organization's resources; non-members cannot. Membership can be granted or revoked by a person who holds the “Role Assigner” role.
