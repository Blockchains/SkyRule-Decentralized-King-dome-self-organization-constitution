<p>The primary self-organization constitution document is <a href="CONSTITUTION.md">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This version of the constitution is new and being vetted by pioneering organizations. Your feedback as a pioneer, practitioner, or engaged observer is very welcome.</p>

<h3>
<a id="principles" class="anchor" href="#principles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Principles</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Distribute Authority</strong> - Members are free to take actions that further the organization's purpose by default.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evolve</strong> - Define organizational rules and roles iteratively based on the challenges that members experience. Make progress even over perfection.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evidence</strong> - Base decisions and actions on evidence.</li>
</ul>

<a id="why-is-this-constitution-needed" class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-constitution-needed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this constitution needed?</h3>

<p>Your group of 2-20 people needs a clear way to fulfill its purpose, make decisions, get things done, and respond to change.</p>

<ul>
<li>To fit your values your constitution must be egalitarian.</li>
<li>In order to respond to change and adapt to your unique context you must be able to evolve your constitution.</li>
<li>To learn from other groups you need to be able to share innovations freely.</li>
<li>In order to build capacity rapidly with changing team members your constitution must also be simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is what you are looking for, <a href="CONSTITUTION.md">this constitution</a> is for you.</p>

<a id="how-do-you-adopt-this-constitution" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-adopt-this-constitution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you adopt this constitution?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Each member of the organization defines roles based on the activities they are currently doing. The mission holders of the organization define the purpose &amp; values through a process they choose.</li>
<li>Grant the roles defined by the organization's members and the default roles: Role Assigner, Facilitator, and Treasurer. Remember, roles can be held by multiple people and people can hold multiple roles.</li>
<li>Have those with sufficient authority ratify the constitution for self-organization.</li>
<li>Have regular meetings to make proposals. Document the proposals in the adopted proposal section below.</li>
</ol>

<a id="why-are-there-no-circles-or-groups-defined-in-the-constitution" class="anchor" href="#why-are-there-no-circles-or-groups-defined-in-the-constitution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why are there no circles or groups defined in the constitution?</h3>

<p>The focus of this constitution is for small groups of 2-20. There are several design patterns for scaling. Rather than biasing in one direction or another at the outset, the constitution gives space for the organization to evolve.</p>

<p>Two potential scaling patterns are: nested holonic circle structures as employed by Sociocracy &amp; Holacracy; and networked structures such as Morning Star's <a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments">Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU)</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute scaling "proposal pattern", your contributions would be welcome. For example you could contribute a sociocracy style double linked circle "proposal pattern".</p>

<a id="inspiration" class="anchor" href="#inspiration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration</h4>

<p>We were greatly inspired by Holacracy, Sociocracy, Morning Star self-management, and the tradition of self-organization stretching back to at least Norbert Wiener's work on Cybernetics.</p>
